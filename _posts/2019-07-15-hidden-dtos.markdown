My New Year's resolution came early this year. I will never use data transfer objects in java
applications again. No getters and setters anymore, thank you. It was not a pleasure and you wont be missed.


My pain is not unique, plenty has been said about dtos and getters and setters. 
They break encapsulation and by using it we separate data from behaviour which moves our design away from OOP paradigm.

I would like to show you a concrete example how you can manipulate data without exposing it to
the rest of the codebase. 

The goal is to clean up our business logic/use cases from unnecessary data exposure. What does it mean?
Let's take a look at the following data class:

'''java
class PatientDto {

    private String ssn;
    private String name;
    private String surname;
    private String address;
    private String nurse;
    
    //getters and setters...
} 
'''

If the use case only uses ssn to verifies patient uniqueness...


   
We have also concept of printers, to let object print itself. 

'''java
class Patient {
    private String ssn, address;
    // stuff
    void print(Media media) {
        media.write("ssn", ssn);
        media.write("address", address);
    }
}
// printing to html
patient.print(htmlForm);
Html html = htmlForm.toHtml();
'''
Only patient object has the information about patient data and it can print 
itself to various media (html, xml, json...). If data changes, only one class
needs to be changed. This is a very powerful OOP tehnique but it has some
drawbacks. What and how.
What if we have additional requirement which ...
  
I propose to give the printer pattern some steroids to let user take full control
of what data should be printed and how.

Let's change the signature a (bit - duplication): 

"""java
class Patient {
    
    private String ssn, address;
    // stuff
    <T> T print(Function<PatientContent, Printable<T> output) {
        return output.apply(new PatientContent(ssn, address)).print();
    }
}
"""

It looks weird but follow me through. Print method now accepts a function


"""java
public class PatientContent
{
    protected final String ssn;
    
    protected final String address;

    public PatientContent(PatientContent content) {
        this(content.ssn, content.address);
    }

    public PatientContent(String ssn, String address)
    {
        this.dto = dto;
    }
}
"""

"""java
public class JsonPatientOutput extends PatientContent implements Printable<JsonObject>
{
    public JsonPatientOutput(PatientContent content)
    {
        super(content);
    }

    @Override
    public JsonObject print()
    {
        return Json.createObjectBuilder().
            .add("ssn", this.ssn)
            .add("address", this.address)
            .build();
    }
}
"""
Now we print the patient to json:
"""java
JsonObject json = patient.print(JsonPatientOutput::new);
"""
This is basically extended version of printer/media pattern. You may find this 
sharing data between derived classes scary but I assure you its perfectly fine.
We are not exposing protected fields outside of the printer context. 
No object other than printer itself can access PatientContent and JsonPatientOutput instances.


Let's play a little bit more and assume that patient in the end will hold much more data.

Remember how I said I wont use getters and setters ever again? Well it's time to 
cheat a little bit because we all know how New Year's resolutions eventually end up. 
Mine took only... Anyway, embrace yourselves.
"""java
public class PatientContent
{
    protected final PatientDto dto;

    public PatientContent(PatientContent content) {
        this(content.dto);
    }

    public PatientContent(PatientDto dto)
    {
        this.dto = dto;
    }
}

@Builder
@ToString
@Getter
public class PatientDto
{
    @NonNull
    private final String ssn;

    @NonNull
    private final String name;

    @NonNull
    private final String address;
    
    //.. other fields
}
"""
Wait, what? 
The fun part is that there are no harm in using the dto in such a manner. 
It cannot be used outside of a printer context.
Bear in mind that such a dto should absolutely be immutable, without exceptions. 
You don't want your derived class to mutate the dto state.
